# FYP_MentalHealth_VideoGame
The small 2D top down game I made for my final year project spreading awareness about mental health for young people.
The goal of this project was to make a video game, that incorporates Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) techniques as a core mechanic of the game.
To accomplish this, I made a dialogue system that allows the player to have conversations with non playable characters.
Each conversation was modelled with relation to the cognitive model

In order to achieve this, I created a system where the player is prompted to respond with a dialogue option.
Depending on how the player responds to the dialogue prompt, the conversation will change which allows the player to actively engage with and practice CBT techniques.
The game also features fully animated player character, a shooting and targeting system, and custom sprites.
